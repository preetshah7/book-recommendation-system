# GoodReads-Recommendation-using-Collaborative-Filtering
Applying collaborative filtering on GoodReads' book reviews.
The dataset that we are using is from “GoodReads,” which is a website that allows users to
freely search their database for books and book reviews.
Solution:
● We will use the user-based Collaborative Filtering model to make predictions and
recommend books to consumers
● This model will determine similar interests from other consumers, for making our
predictions and recommendations
Benefits:
● Improve marketing strategies
● Better inventory control for each product
● Higher sales and revenues
The models that can we use for our recommendation are as follows:
● K- nearest neighbor model (from cosine similarity)
● Simple Recommendation Model
These are ranked as per their practical use. The simple recommendation model is very outdated
and is a decade-old method with really less accuracy. On the other hand the k-nearest neighbor
model gives us higher accuracy
